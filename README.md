A portfolio page using media queries for responsive content

The goal of this page was to use my previously designed portfolio page and make it more accessable and cleaner looking on different screen sizes. I achieved this through the use of media queries, with breaks at screen widths of 980px, 768px, and 640px.

Due to my previous styling, the application of media queries was fairly seamless, which I assume is from my attempt to use percentages for dimensions where I could.

Overall, I am very pleased with the turnout of the site on smaller screens, and will be using a mobile-first design strategy going forward in order to maintain this level of responsiveness.
